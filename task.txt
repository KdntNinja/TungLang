# GCSE Computer Science Programming Task

## Task: Currency Converter

Create a simple currency converter program in TungLang (or any language you're comfortable with). This task covers key GCSE CS concepts including variables, input/output, selection, and mathematical operations.

### Requirements:

1. Display a welcome message explaining the program
2. Show a menu of available currency conversions:
   - 1: Pounds to Euros
   - 2: Pounds to Dollars
   - 3: Euros to Pounds
   - 4: Dollars to Pounds

3. Ask the user to select an option (1-4)
4. Ask the user to enter the amount to convert
5. Calculate the conversion using these rates:
   - £1 = €1.17
   - £1 = $1.29

6. Display the result with appropriate formatting (2 decimal places)
7. Ask if the user wants to perform another conversion (yes/no)
8. If yes, repeat from step 2, otherwise exit the program with a goodbye message

### Extension Tasks:
- Add input validation to ensure the user enters a valid option and amount
- Allow the user to enter their own exchange rates
- Create a log of all conversions performed in a session

This task tests students' ability to handle user input, perform conditional logic, apply mathematical operations, and create a simple loop structure - all key concepts at GCSE CS level.
